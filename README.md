[![Build Status](https://github.com/svelle/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/svelle/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Overview

The Mattermost PagerDuty Plugin integrates PagerDuty with Mattermost, allowing teams to view on-call schedules and current on-call users directly within Mattermost. This plugin provides quick access to PagerDuty information through a convenient sidebar interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Schedule Browser**: View all PagerDuty schedules in a clean, organized list
- **Timeline View**: Click any schedule to see a detailed 48-hour timeline showing:
  - Who's currently on-call (highlighted with special styling)
  - Upcoming shifts with countdown timers
  - Smooth transitions between on-call personnel
- **Direct Paging**: Page the current on-call person directly from the schedule view
- **Right-Hand Sidebar**: Dedicated sidebar accessible via channel header button
- **Real-time Data**: Always shows current information - no background syncing needed
- **Secure Configuration**: API tokens are stored securely and never exposed in the UI

### User Interface
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy back button to switch between schedule list and details
- **Visual Indicators**: Current on-call person prominently displayed with colored background and badges
- **Relative Time Display**: Shows human-friendly time format ("2h 30m remaining", "Starts in 1d 4h")
- **Paging Interface**: One-click paging with incident creation dialog
- **Responsive Design**: Clean layout that works well in the Mattermost sidebar
- **Theme Support**: Automatically adapts to your Mattermost theme (light/dark)
- **Enhanced Styling**: Comprehensive CSS classes for customization

### Configuration
- **PagerDuty API Token**: Secure token storage for API authentication
- **Custom API URL**: Support for self-hosted or regional PagerDuty instances

## Requirements

- Mattermost Server v6.2.1 or higher
- PagerDuty account with API access
- PagerDuty API token

## Installation

1. Download the latest plugin file from the [releases page](https://github.com/svelle/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/releases)
2. In Mattermost, go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management**
3. Upload the plugin file
4. Enable the plugin

## Configuration

After installing the plugin, configure it in **System Console > Plugins > PagerDuty**:

1. **PagerDuty API Token**: Enter your PagerDuty API token
   - Generate a token in PagerDuty: **Configuration > API Access Keys**
   - Ensure the token has read access to schedules and users
   - For paging functionality, the token needs write access to create incidents

2. **PagerDuty API Base URL**: (Optional) Customize if using a non-standard PagerDuty instance
   - Default: `https://api.pagerduty.com`

## Usage

- **Visual Timeline**: Color-coded entries with the current on-call highlighted
- **Direct Paging**: "📟 Page Now" button for the current on-call person

### Paging Functionality
