[![Build Status](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Overview

The Mattermost PagerDuty Plugin integrates PagerDuty with Mattermost, allowing teams to view on-call schedules and current on-call users directly within Mattermost. This plugin provides quick access to PagerDuty information through a sidebar interface and slash commands.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Schedule Browser**: View all PagerDuty schedules in a clean, organized list
- **Timeline View**: Click any schedule to see a detailed 24-hour timeline showing:
  - Who's currently on-call (highlighted with special styling)
  - Upcoming shifts with countdown timers
  - Smooth transitions between on-call personnel
- **Right-Hand Sidebar**: Dedicated sidebar accessible via channel header button
- **Real-time Data**: Always shows current information - no background syncing needed
- **Secure Configuration**: API tokens are stored securely and never exposed in the UI

### User Interface
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy back button to switch between schedule list and details
- **Visual Indicators**: Current on-call person prominently displayed with colored background
- **Time Display**: Shows both time and date for clarity (e.g., "Tomorrow at 09:00")
- **Responsive Design**: Clean layout that works well in the Mattermost sidebar
- **Theme Support**: Automatically adapts to your Mattermost theme (light/dark)

### Slash Commands
- `/pagerduty help` - Display available commands and usage
- `/pagerduty schedules` - List all PagerDuty schedules directly in chat
- `/pagerduty oncall` - Show who's currently on-call with shift end times

### Configuration
- **PagerDuty API Token**: Secure token storage for API authentication
- **Custom API URL**: Support for self-hosted or regional PagerDuty instances

## Requirements

- Mattermost Server v6.2.1 or higher
- PagerDuty account with API access
- PagerDuty API token

## Installation

1. Download the latest plugin file from the [releases page](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-pagerduty-plugin/releases)
2. In Mattermost, go to **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management**
3. Upload the plugin file
4. Enable the plugin

## Configuration

After installing the plugin, configure it in **System Console > Plugins > PagerDuty**:

1. **PagerDuty API Token**: Enter your PagerDuty API token
   - Generate a token in PagerDuty: **Configuration > API Access Keys**
   - Ensure the token has read access to schedules and users

2. **PagerDuty API Base URL**: (Optional) Customize if using a non-standard PagerDuty instance
   - Default: `https://api.pagerduty.com`

## Usage

### Opening the Sidebar

1. Look for the PagerDuty icon in the channel header (green icon with "P")
2. Click it to open the right-hand sidebar
3. The sidebar will load and display all your PagerDuty schedules

### Viewing Schedules

1. The main view shows all available schedules with:
   - Schedule name
   - Description (if available)
   - Timezone information
2. Click on any schedule to see detailed on-call information

### Timeline View

When you click on a schedule, you'll see:
- **Current On-Call**: Prominently displayed at the top with a blue background
- **Next 24 Hours**: A timeline showing all upcoming on-call transitions
- **Time Until Next**: Countdown showing when the next person goes on-call
- **Visual Timeline**: Color-coded entries with the current on-call highlighted

### Navigation

- Use the **‚Üê back arrow** to return to the schedule list
- Click **Refresh** to get the latest data
- Click the same schedule again to refresh its details

### Slash Commands

Quick commands available in any channel:

#### `/pagerduty help`
Shows available commands and usage instructions.

#### `/pagerduty schedules`
Lists all PagerDuty schedules with:
- Schedule names and descriptions
- Timezone information
- Quick overview of available schedules

#### `/pagerduty oncall`
Shows who's currently on-call with:
- Grouped by schedule
- User names and email addresses
- When their shift ends (e.g., "until 5:00 PM today")
- Escalation levels if applicable

All slash command responses are ephemeral (only visible to you) to avoid cluttering channels.
